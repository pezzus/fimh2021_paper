This paper describes a method to characterize the uncertainty in the ECG induced by the uncertainty in the lead positioning. The authors use the bidomain model coupled with a low-rank approach to solve the uncertainty quantification problem. The approach is analyzed in a simple (2D?) geometry. This study is certainly interesting for the FIMH community as it investigates the uncertainty related to modeling the ECG based on the lead locations. However, in the current form, the formulation is difficult to understand and the results and discussion sections are very limited. I hope the authors can improve the current presentation of their work as I think this study will be very relevant and helpful for the community.

A few comments/concerns to be considered:
1) The authors use a lead field approach and, if I understood correctly, claim that the transmembrane voltage Vm in the heart can be computed separately from the torso model. However, Vm is still affected by the different boundary condition applied at the torso/heart interface. Is this the case in the authors’ approach? 

2) Does the authors' approach require the assumption that the torso domain is very large with respect to the heart? Or the larger it is, the better is the introduced approximation? I understand that this may be obvious to the authors but it is lost to the general reader thinking at the classic lead field approach to compute the ECG.

3) Before eq 4, the authors make the assumption that the electrodes' positions are not know exactly and their collection is independent. Is the “independent” assumption realistic? Can the authors explain their reasoning? 

4) Can the authors clarify the advantages of their approach versus solving the bidomain problem in the heart only and then propagating the solution in the torso and measuring the voltage in the neighbor of the lead placements? This second approach as well will only require the solution of one problem in the torso.

5) The setup leading to the results shown in Figure 2 and the results presented should be commented more extensively. For example, why is a tanh function chosen for Vm? Can different expected ECG traces be reported as well in addition to the shaded confidence interval? What is the reason for the discrepancy between the bidomain and the expected ECG solution?


Minor comments: several typos are present (e.g., shared in the caption of Fig. 2 should be shaded) and should be corrected before resubmission.

SUMMARY
================
The authors propose a method for quantifying the uncertainty in the electrocardiogram (ECG) potential, simulated using the bidomain model, due to the uncertainty in the electrodes' position. They use a lead-field formulation in combination with low-rank approximations of the ECG potential's temporal correlations. The method is validated on a simple 2D geometry of the torso and the heart. This is done by comparing the expected ECG potential (with confidence interval) with the ECG potential obtained from a forward run of the full bidomain model.

================
GENERAL COMMENTS
================
The methodology is sound and mathematically well presented. The authors have addressed an important question that arises from practical situations, i.e. characterising how an ECG potential can deviate from the reference observed one as the exact electrodes spatial configuration is uncertain. The validation section does provide a working example application of the methodology although sometimes lacking clarity and needs to be improved.

SPECIFIC COMMENTS
================
(1) It is not clear how the two electrodes \xi_1, \xi_2 distributions are taken. Are they uniformly distributed over an ellipsoid surface? If yes, in this specific case this corresponds to be uniformly distributed over a plane curve (which is not trivial to formalise). What is the density of those distributions? The authors only mention that the distributions have a certain mean \bar{\xi}_1, \bar{\xi}_2 (which I guess are the exact 2D locations displayed in Fig. 1) and a support of 2\delta. I don't understand what is \delta here, needs to be clarified. If with the assumption of "densities strongly localized" the authors mean that the electrodes distributions are over a piece of curve which can be approximated by a line (therefore a classic uniform distribution over a 1D interval U([a, b])), I wonder how big is considered to be the uncertainty in the electrodes' positions (what is the variance of these distributions). This need to be clarified as well.

(2) Overall, the authors should provide more details in the validation section to make the example be reproducible, such as:
- A table with all the bidomain/lead-field model constant values (not only the reference to them)
- The exact parameter values used to generate the geometry (e.g., if analytically described by an ellipse for the torso, x1^2/a^2 + x2^2/b^2 = 1: provide a and b; by a circle for the heart, (x1-x10)^2 + (x1-x20)^2 = r^2: provide (x10,x20) and r)
- The exact electrodes distributions densities used with specific mean values (2D coordinates) and possibly variances values.

(3) Fig. 2 should be presented more clearly:
- The left panel is missing a colorbar with label and units to match the colour scheme used for what I think is the potential field.
- The right panel is missing both the x-axis and the y-axis labels with units. Also, a figure legend with a black line, a blue line and a shaded blue rectangle could help the reader to immediately compare bidomain ECG with expected ECG + uncertainty.
- I guess the x-axis is time. Why does it start from negative values?

(4) The way in which the confidance interval has been obtained starting from the estimated ECG correlations needs to be explained.

(6) Why is not the classic lead-field ECG solution not displayed? If possible, the authors should add this to compare: full bidomain VS lead-field VS expected lead-filed + uncertainty.

(5) The authors should provide additional information on the computational time of the proposed methodology. If lead-field CPU-time << full bidomain CPU-time, and they state that expected-ECG CPU-time ~= lead-field CPU-time, how does the uncertainty-on-ECG CPU-time compare with the other quantities? This could be added in the discussion section.
